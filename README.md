# ec2instance

This is a simple deployment of an EC2 instance in AWS, using Terraform. Useful when I need to test something on a live instance - instead of provisioning every single aspect, I just change a some configs here or there in this template.

- Worth noting: object names, such as `exemplo_vpc` and `exemplo_subnet` are defined in Portuguese, for clarifying its arbitrary nature.
